# Dash-app

In this Dash app, two data sets are used to perform descriptive statistics, interactive and dynamic graphics and statistical models.

## House prices dataset
- The first data set is related to the sale prices of houses sold in the city of Windsor, Canada, during July, August and September 1987.
- A dynamic table is made in which the original data can be seen as a filter clicking on the tabs that appear above. 
- You can view several types of dynamic graphs (histograms, scatterplots and boxplots) in which you can interact by filtering and selecting points that will be shown in the tables below them.
- A multiple linear regression model is used to make predictions of house prices. For this, the data was split in training (80%) to fit the model and test (20%) to make the prediction and performance.


## Diabetes dataset

- The second data set is based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes or not.
- A dynamic table is made in which the original data can be seen as a filter clicking on the tabs that appear above. 
- You can view several types of dynamic graphs (histograms and boxplots) in which you can interact by filtering and selecting points that will be shown in the tables below them.
- A logistic regression model is used to make predictions of diabetes classification. For this, the data was split in training (80%) to fit the model and test (20%) to make the prediction and performance.
